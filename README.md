# tdd-fairness-app-assignment

This simple app will just be a single function that accepts 2 values. Build this app in TDD approach.
**You must write the test first, have it failed, then write the necessary code for it to pass**

1. This function must only accept 2 values
2. It will return a success message if 2 values (must be float) are equal
3. It will return a fail message if 2 values are not equal
4. It will return an error message if 2 values are not floats.

# Important

1. Write a single test first (for example for #1), see the test fail, write the code for the test to pass, see the test pass.
2. Then proceed to the other features.

# Instructions

1. You will need to run the node server first before running any tests. 
2. Make sure you work on this assignment in a docker container. The necessarily files to build and run this app in a docker container is already provided.
3. Once done, you need to zip your app in one file and upload the zipped file in Hacker Hero.
